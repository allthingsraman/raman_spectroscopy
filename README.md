# raman_spectroscopy

> **_Edit Feb 2023_:**  I see this repo has gained a bit of traction recently, though it's fair to say I'm not overly proud of the coding standards I displayed 7 years ago - if you need help, an explanation, or some amendments, **please feel free to open an issue or PR on this repo and I will do my best to review**. 


Source code to my 2016 Master's dissertation supplementary code: Developing Sustainable Materials (CZTS) for Thin-Film Solar Devices Using Raman and Photoluminescence Spectroscopy

The code here cleans, removes baselines, finds the peaks of Raman spectroscopic lineshapes and autonomously fit convolutional Lorentzian's to the spectra. This allows you to **systematically identify the composite molecular compounds** present within a material sample for hundreds of spectra instantaneously, **a task that typically takes many hours/ days of a skilled researcher's time**.
